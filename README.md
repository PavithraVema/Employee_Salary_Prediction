# 🧑‍💼 Employee Salary Prediction System

A machine learning-based web application that predicts an employee's salary based on multiple features such as experience, education level, job role, location, and age.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build an intelligent system that helps HR departments and job seekers estimate fair salary expectations using historical data and regression techniques.

---

## 📊 Features Used for Prediction

- Experience (years)
- Age
- Education (Bachelor, Master, PhD)
- Role (e.g., Data Analyst, Backend Developer)
- Location (Tier 1 / Tier 2 city)

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

The following regression models can be used:

### ✅ Linear Regression (default)
- Simple, fast, interpretable
- May predict negative values (clamped to ₹0 in the app)

### 🟡 Random Forest Regressor (optional upgrade)
- Non-linear model, better accuracy
- Handles feature interaction better than Linear Regression

📁 Model and encoders are saved as `.pkl` files using `joblib`.
